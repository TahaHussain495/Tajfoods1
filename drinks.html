    <h1>DRINKS</h1>

    <p>Refreshing drinks play an essential role in completing a meal, especially in hot climates like Pakistan, where they provide a cooling and satisfying end to a flavorful feast. Popular options include lassi, a traditional yogurt-based drink that can be either sweet or salty, offering a refreshing and tangy flavor. Mint lemonade or nimbu pani, made with fresh lime, mint, and sugar, is another go-to drink that provides a zesty and cooling sensation after a meal. Sodas such as cola or sparkling lemon drinks are commonly served in fast food joints to complement fried or spicy dishes. In the summer months, fruit juices like mango, orange, or apple juice are refreshing and hydrating choices. For those seeking something more indulgent, milkshakes made with chocolate, vanilla, or fruit offer a rich, creamy treat to finish off a meal. These drinks are not only thirst-quenching but also help in digestion, making them a perfect choice after a hearty meal.
