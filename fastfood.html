   <h1>Fast Food</h1> 
   <a href="fastfood.html"TAJ FOODS></a>
   <p>Fast food is extremely popular in Pakistan due to its convenience, affordability, and the country’s growing urban lifestyle. With a fast-paced routine becoming the norm, especially in major cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, people often opt for quick meals instead of traditional home-cooked food. The appeal of global fast-food chains like McDonald’s, KFC, and Pizza Hut, along with local favorites such as biryani, burgers, and shawarma, caters to diverse tastes and preferences. Additionally, fast food is a common choice for social gatherings, family outings, and celebrations, making it an integral part of the dining culture. Its availability across various price ranges, from street vendors to high-end outlets, also contributes to its widespread popularity among all socioeconomic groups in Pakistan.
