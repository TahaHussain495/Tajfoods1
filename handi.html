    <h1>Handi</h1>

    <p>Handi is a traditional cooking vessel used in South Asian cuisine, particularly in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is a deep, wide-mouthed, and often heavy pot, typically made of clay, copper, or brass. The handi is designed for slow cooking, which allows the flavors of the ingredients to blend beautifully over low heat. This method is especially common in dishes like biryani, curries, and stews, where the food is simmered for hours to achieve rich, aromatic flavors. The thick walls of the handi help retain heat evenly, making it ideal for preparing meals that require precise temperature control. Beyond its functionality, the handi is also a symbol of cultural heritage, often associated with traditional family gatherings and festive occasions.
